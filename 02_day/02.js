// Day 2: operators
// Tasks/Activities:
// Activity 1: Arithmetic Operations

// Task 1: Write a program to add two numbers and log the result
// to the console.

const addition = (x, y) => x + y;
const num1 = 10;
const num2 = 2;
const sum = addition(num1, num2);
console.log(sum);

// Task 2: Write a program to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console.

const subtraction = (x, y) => x - y;
const subtract = subtraction(num1, num2);
console.log(subtract);

// Task 3: Write a program to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console.

const multiplication = (x, y) => x * y;
const multiply = multiplication(num1, num2);
console.log(multiply);

// Task 4: Write a program to divide two numbers and log the result to the console.

const divide = (x, y) => x / y;
const division = divide(num1, num2);
console.log(division);

// Task 5: Write a program to find the remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to the console.

const remainder = (x, y) => x % y;
const remain = remainder(num1, num2);
console.log(remain);

// Activity 2: Assignment operators
// Task 6: use the += operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console.
let a = 5;
console.log((a += 2));

// Task 7: use the -= operator to subtract a number from a variable and log the result to the console.
let b = 7;
console.log((b -= 2));

// Activity 3: Comparision Operators
// Task 8: write a program to compare two numbers using > and < and log the result to the console.



// Task 9: write a program to compare two numbers using >= and <= and log the result to the console.
// Task 10: write a program to compare two numbers using == and === and log the result to the console.

// Activity 4: Logical operators
// Task 11: write a program that uses the && operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
// Task 12: write a program that uses the || operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
// Task 13: write a program that uses the ! operator to negate a condition and log the result to the console.

// Activity 5: Ternary operator
// Task 14: write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative and log the result to the console.


// Feature Request:
// 1. arithmetic operations script: write a script that performs
// basic arithmetic oprations(addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder) on two numbers and logs the results.

// 2. comparision and logical operators script: create a script that compares two numbers using different comparision operators and combines conditions using logical operators, logging the results.

// 3. Ternary operator script: write a script that uses the ternary operator to determine if a number is positive or negative and logs the result.

// Achievement:
// By the end of these activities, students will:
// *understand and use arithmetic operators to perform basic calculations.
// *use assignment operators to modify variable values.
// *compare values using comparision operators.
// *combine conditions using logical operators.
// *use the ternary operator for concise conditional expressions.
