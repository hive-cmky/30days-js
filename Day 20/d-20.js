// Day 20: LocalStorage and SessionStorage
// Tasks/Activities:
// Activity 1: Understanding LocalStorage
// Task 1: write a script to save a string value to localStorage and retrieve it. Log the retrieved value.
// Task 2: write a script to save an object to localStorage by converting it to a JSON string. Retrieve and parse the object, then log it.

// Activity 2: Using LocalStorage
// Task 3: Create a simple form that saves user input (e.g., name and email to localStorage when submitted. Retrieve and display the saved data on page load.
// Task 4: write a script to remove an item from localStorage. Log the localStorage content before and after removal.

// Activity 3: Understanding SessionStorage
// Task 5: write a script to save a string value to sessionStorage and retrieve it. Log the retrieved value.
// Task 6: write a script to save an object to sessionStorage by converting it to a JSON string. Retrieve and parse the object, then log it.

// Activity 4: Using SessionStorage
// Task 7: Create a simple form that saves user input (e.g., name and email) to sessionStorage when submitted. Retrieve and display the saved data on page load.
// Task 8: write a script to remove an item from sessionStorage. Log the sessionStorage content before and after removal.

// Activity 5: Comparing LocalStorage and SessionStorage
// Task 9: write a function that accepts a key and a value and saves the value to both localStorage and sessionStorage. Retrieve and log the values from both storage mechanisms.
// Task 10: write a function that clears all data from both localStorage and sessionStorage. Verify that both storages are empty.

// Feature Request: 
// 1. LocalStorage Script: write a script that saves, retrieves and removes items from localStorage and displays and saved data on page load.
// 2. SessionStorage Script: Create a script that saves,retrieves and removes items from sessionStorage, and displays the saved data on page load.
// 3. Storage Comaparision Script: write a script that saves data to both localStorage and sessionStorage, retrieves the data and compares the results.
// 4. Clear Storage Script: Create a script that clears all data from both localStorage and sessionStorage and verifies the operation.

// Achievement:
// By the end of these activities students will:
// * Understand how to use localStorage and sessionStorage for persistent and session-specific data storage.
// * Save, retrieve and remove data from both localStorage and sessionStorage.
// * Implement form data storage using localStorage and sessionStorage.
// * Compare and contrast the use cases for localStorage and sessionStorage.
